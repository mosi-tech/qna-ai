"""Portfolio allocation functions using PyPortfolioOpt and industry-standard libraries.

This module provides asset allocation functionality for portfolio construction and
management. All calculations leverage established libraries from requirements.txt
to ensure accuracy and avoid code duplication.

The functions are designed to integrate with the financial-analysis-function-library.json
specification and provide standardized outputs for the MCP analytics server.

Example:
    Basic usage of portfolio allocation functions:
    
    >>> from mcp.analytics.portfolio.allocation import PORTFOLIO_ALLOCATION_FUNCTIONS
    >>> # Functions will be added here as the module expands
    
Note:
    This module is currently a placeholder for future allocation functions.
    Functions will be added based on requirements from the broader analytics system.
