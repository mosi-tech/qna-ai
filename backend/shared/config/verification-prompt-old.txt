Before we proceed, I need to verify something important:

{question}

**Verification**: Please check the generated script carefully:
1. Does the script logic directly answer the specific question asked?
2. Are all conditions/signals mentioned in the question actually used to drive the analysis/decisions?
3. Is the question answered sufficiently given some assumptions or defaults? 

If you made certain assumptions/defaults, add those in OUTPUT format below.

If the script does NOT fully answer the question or ignores important conditions/signals, please STOP and recreate the script to fully address the question.
