### Generation Instructions:

**Step 1: Duplicate Check Process**
1. First, carefully review all existing questions listed in the "Existing Questions to Avoid Duplicates" section above
2. Create a mental map of already-covered topics, analysis types, and stock symbols
3. Identify gaps and unexplored areas for new question generation

**Step 2: Generate New Questions**
**IMPORTANT**: Only generate questions from categories that are NOT marked with [SKIP]. Skip any categories marked with [SKIP] entirely.

Generate 50-100 unique questions covering ONLY the active (non-skipped) categories above. Ensure variety in:
- Question types (performance, analysis, discovery, screening)
- Asset classes (stocks, ETFs, sectors, options)  
- Time horizons (intraday, weekly, monthly, yearly)
- Complexity levels (simple lookups to complex analysis)
- Market conditions (bull market, bear market, volatility)

**Categories to SKIP** (marked with [SKIP] prefix):
- Fundamental Analysis
- Income & Dividend Investing  
- Advanced Options & Derivatives
- Fixed Income & Interest Rate Analysis
- Alternative & International Investing
- ESG & Sustainable Investing

Focus questions on the remaining active categories for optimal API compatibility.

**Step 3: Final Duplicate Validation**
Before finalizing, double-check each generated question against existing ones to ensure:
- No semantic duplicates (same intent, different wording)
- No overlapping analysis requests
- Genuinely new value for the question bank

## ❌ AVOID These Question Types (Based on Validation Analysis)

**The following question patterns have been validated and found to be unimplementable with available APIs. DO NOT generate similar questions:**

### **Fixed Income & Bond Analytics**
- Bond duration, convexity, or yield curve analysis
- Credit spreads, term premiums, or bond pricing models  
- Interest rate sensitivity beyond sector-level analysis
- Examples to AVOID:
  - "What's the duration of bonds in my portfolio?"
  - "What's the credit spread on high-yield bonds?"
  - "What's the convexity risk in my bond holdings?"

### **Advanced Portfolio Analytics** ⚠️ **UPDATED: Now Available via ETF Proxies**
- Complex factor modeling without ETF proxies
- Risk modeling (VaR, tracking error, beta stability) without benchmark comparisons
- Examples to AVOID (unless using ETF proxies):
  - "What's my portfolio's value at risk calculation?" (still avoid - too complex)
  - "What's my portfolio's exposure to systematic risk factors?" (avoid without ETF context)
  - "What's my portfolio's risk-adjusted alpha generation?" (avoid - needs specialized models)

### **Complex Options & Derivatives**
- Options volatility surfaces, Greeks, or advanced pricing
- Implied volatility rankings or percentiles
- Options flow analysis or directional indicators
- Examples to AVOID:
  - "What's the implied volatility rank of SPY options?"
  - "What's the options flow suggesting about market direction?"
  - "What's the volatility surface showing for index options?"

### **External Regulatory & Pipeline Data**
- FDA approval calendars or drug pipeline data
- Regulatory milestone tracking or approval timelines
- Clinical trial status or regulatory submissions
- Examples to AVOID:
  - "Which pharmaceutical stocks have FDA approval catalysts?"
  - "What drugs are in Phase 3 clinical trials?"
  - "Which companies have regulatory approvals pending?"

### **Macroeconomic Predictions & Forecasting**
- Future interest rate or economic predictions
- Market timing based on economic indicators
- Predictive analysis or forecasting models
- Examples to AVOID:
  - "What's the yield curve telling us about future rates?"
  - "What's the economic surprise index suggesting about growth?"
  - "How will inflation affect my portfolio next year?"

### **Commodities & Futures Analytics**
- Commodity futures curves (backwardation/contango)
- Roll yield, carry trades, or basis risk analysis
- Commodity-specific production cost data
- Examples to AVOID:
  - "Which commodities are in backwardation right now?"
  - "What's the roll yield in commodity futures?"
  - "Which oil stocks have the lowest production costs?"

### **Tax & Specialized Analytics**
- Tax-loss harvesting optimization
- Tax lot analysis or realized/unrealized gains tracking
- Complex tax strategy recommendations
- Examples to AVOID:
  - "What's my tax-loss harvesting opportunity?"
  - "How should I optimize my tax-advantaged accounts?"
  - "What's my unrealized capital gains exposure?"

### **High-Frequency Trading & Execution**
- Execution quality analysis or HFT impact
- Market microstructure analysis
- Order flow or liquidity analysis
- Examples to AVOID:
  - "What's the HFT impact on my execution quality?"
  - "How does order flow affect my trades?"
  - "What's my average execution slippage?"

### **Sentiment & Flow Analysis**
- Put/call ratios or sentiment indicators  
- Institutional vs retail flow divergence
- Advanced sentiment analysis beyond basic news
- Examples to AVOID:
  - "What's the put/call ratio indicating about sentiment?"
  - "What's the sentiment divergence between retail and institutions?"
  - "How do insider flows correlate with price movements?"

## ✅ FOCUS ON These Implementable Question Types Instead:

**Generate questions around these proven patterns:**
- **Sector screening with fundamental metrics** (profit margins, debt ratios, growth rates)
- **Company comparisons within sectors** (best/worst performers, rankings)
- **Portfolio composition analysis** (sector allocation, market cap exposure, geographic breakdown)
- **Basic performance metrics** (returns, volatility, correlation with major indices)
- **Screening questions** (stocks meeting specific criteria, ETF comparisons)
- **News and earnings analysis** (earnings calendar, recent news sentiment)
- **Dividend and income analysis** (yield rankings, dividend growth, payout ratios)

**🆕 NOW AVAILABLE: Advanced Analytics via ETF Proxies:**
- **Factor exposure analysis** using value/growth ETF correlations (VTV vs VUG)
- **Size bias detection** comparing with VB (small), VO (mid), VV (large-cap) ETFs
- **Style drift analysis** tracking momentum (MTUM) vs quality (QUAL) vs low-vol (USMV) correlations
- **International diversification** measuring correlation with VEA, VWO, VGK regional ETFs
- **Sector rotation timing** analyzing relative performance vs sector ETF benchmarks (XLK, XLE, XLF, etc.)
- **Risk-adjusted performance** using Sharpe ratios vs benchmark ETFs (SPY, IWM, QQQ)
- **Tracking error approximation** measuring deviation from target benchmark ETFs
- **Market regime analysis** comparing portfolio behavior vs different factor ETFs during market cycles
- **Bond allocation effects** using bond ETF proxies (TLT, SHY, LQD, HYG) for fixed income analysis

**Important**: Focus on generating diverse questions that avoid the problematic patterns above while covering the full spectrum of retail investor interests using implementable data sources.

**Output Format**: Provide questions as a numbered list, one question per line.
