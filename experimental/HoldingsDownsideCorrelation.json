  "description": "Analysis of portfolio holdings' correlation with SPY specifically during SPY down days over the past 90 days. This downside correlation metric shows which holdings move most closely with market declines, indicating lowest diversification benefit during stress periods. Higher correlation values mean the holding tends to fall when the market falls, while lower or negative values suggest better downside protection.",
