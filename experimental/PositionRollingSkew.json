  "description": "This analysis identifies which of your current positions have the highest rolling skew of daily returns over the past 30 days. Rolling skewness measures the asymmetry of return distributions - positive skew indicates more frequent small losses with occasional large gains (momentum-like behavior), while negative skew suggests frequent small gains with occasional large losses (mean-reversion patterns). Understanding position skew helps assess risk characteristics and behavioral patterns of your holdings, providing insights into which positions exhibit momentum versus mean-reversion tendencies.",
