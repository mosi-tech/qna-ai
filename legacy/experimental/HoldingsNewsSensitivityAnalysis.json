  "description": "This analysis identifies which portfolio holdings are most sensitive to headline-driven volatility spikes by correlating position price movements with news volume and volatility increases. Using 90 days of price data and news activity, it measures each holding's volatility expansion during high-news periods and calculates sensitivity scores based on price reaction magnitude and correlation with headline events. This helps investors understand which positions require closer monitoring during news cycles and may benefit from adjusted position sizing or hedging strategies during periods of elevated market uncertainty.",
