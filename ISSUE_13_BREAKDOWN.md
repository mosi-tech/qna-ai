# Issue #13 Implementation Breakdown

## Summary
Issue #13 "Create execution server with timeout/resource limits and error recovery" has been analyzed and broken down into specific sub-issues for implementation.

## Current Implementation Status

### ✅ Already Implemented
- **Queue System Retry Logic**: MongoDB queue has built-in retry with configurable `max_retries` (default 3)
- **Queue System Timeouts**: Configurable via `timeout_seconds` field in queue documents
- **Basic Failure Handling**: Error classification and reporting exists in shared execution logic
- **Queue System Graceful Handling**: Comprehensive nack/ack system with worker management

### ❌ Missing Components
The following sub-issues have been created to complete issue #13:

## Sub-Issues Created

### Issue #98: Add memory/CPU resource limits to execution servers
**Priority**: High
- Implement resource constraints for both HTTP and queue-based execution servers
- Set memory limits (e.g., 1GB max per execution)
- Set CPU limits (e.g., max 2 cores per execution)
- Apply to both execution paths

### Issue #99: Add configurable timeouts to HTTP execution server  
**Priority**: Medium
- Make HTTP execution server timeouts configurable (currently hardcoded 300s)
- Accept timeout parameter in API requests
- Support environment variable for default timeout

### Issue #100: Add automatic retry logic to HTTP execution server
**Priority**: Medium  
- Implement retry logic for HTTP server to match queue system capabilities
- Exponential backoff between retries
- Configurable max retries

### Issue #101: Enhance graceful failure handling for production execution
**Priority**: Medium
- Improve error classification and handling
- Better cleanup on execution failures  
- Dead letter queue for permanently failed executions

## Implementation Architecture

### Current Execution Paths
1. **HTTP Direct Execution**: `backend/scriptEdition/executionServer/http_script_execution_server.py`
2. **Queue-Based Execution**: `backend/shared/queue/` system with MongoDB persistence

### Shared Components
- `backend/shared/execution/script_executor.py` - Core execution logic used by both paths
- Both paths use the same script execution foundation but have different capabilities

## Next Steps
1. Implement sub-issues #98 (resource limits) and #99-101 
2. All sub-issues target the same core execution infrastructure
3. Queue system is more mature - HTTP server needs to catch up
4. Resource limits (#98) affects both systems equally

## Conclusion
Issue #13's "robust execution engine" vision is partially implemented through the queue system. The sub-issues will complete the remaining gaps and bring both execution paths to production readiness.
